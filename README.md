# Zend Framework MkDocs Theme

This repository contains the MkDocs theme proposed for Zend Framework
documentation.

It is forked from the dist-build of the [Cinder](tps://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder)
theme, by Chris Simpkins, with the following modifications:

- Footer modifications to link to the ZF project.
- Some CSS modifications for navbar color, default text size and line spacing,
  etc.
- Updates to use a [prismjs](http://prismjs.com) build for syntax highlighting.
